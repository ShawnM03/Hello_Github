# Hello_Github
The Follow along guide for my Github Intro, 

Welcome Github viewers to my profile and first initial work/repository at Github,

I am looking to follow those who have a lot more experience with python and machine learning, data science.

I will soon be adding projects and Juypter Notebooks to my Github so if I accidentally step on your toes I am sorry
